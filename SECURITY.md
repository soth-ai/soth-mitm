# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied on the latest `main` branch and latest published crate release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the repository `Security` tab.
2. Click `Report a vulnerability`.
3. Provide reproduction details, impact, and affected commit/tag.

If Security Advisories are unavailable for your environment, open a minimal issue that asks maintainers for a private reporting channel and do not include exploit details.

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage acknowledgement target: within 5 business days.
- If accepted, a fix plan and timeline will be shared privately.
- Public disclosure will happen after a fix is available or mitigation guidance is published.
