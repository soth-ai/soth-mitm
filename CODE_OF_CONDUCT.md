# Code of Conduct

## Our Standard

We are committed to a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone.

Examples of expected behavior:

- constructive technical discussion
- respectful disagreement
- accepting feedback in good faith

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- trolling, intimidation, or abusive language
- publishing private information without permission

## Scope

This applies in project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and other official communication channels.

## Reporting

For sensitive conduct reports, use a private channel via the repository security advisory mechanism (`SECURITY.md`) and mark it as a conduct report. Do not file sensitive incidents publicly.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions and interactions that violate this policy.
